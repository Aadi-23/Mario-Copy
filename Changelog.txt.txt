1. Removed audio - removing the loadSound code from main.cpp. This code was pre-added by Filippo, so we just removed it. (Aayush Sarcar)

2. Project Settings - now warning level is set to level 1 and I also changed it so that all warnings get treated as an error. As per project requirements, we are supposed to only deal with level 4 warnings.
